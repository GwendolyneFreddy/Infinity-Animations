		<h2>Overview</h2><br>

		<p>
			This mod patches Baldur's Gate II: Throne of Bhaal to support additional creature and character animations (referred to as 'animation slots'). It also offers a dynamic automated process for claiming new animation slots. Thus, it acts as a central hub, usable by anyone who would like to add animation entries to the game without being bogged down by issues of mod conflicts and incompatibilities.
		</p>
		<p>
			Infinity Animations supports a wide variety of animation types from Baldur's Gate I, Baldur's Gate II, Icewind Dale I, Icewind Dale II, Planescape: Torment and Neverwinter Nights. As an added bonus, the mod restores Baldur's Gate I character animations in their entirety, and paperdolls have been unlocked for some animations that did not support them previously.
		</p>
		<p>
			An important feature for players who use several large mods (known as 'megamods') is a resolution of animation conflicts, and a restoration of standard animations that megamods have overwritten.
		</p>
		<p>
			Finally, this mod contains optional components that implement many new animations into the game. Ongoing work will address sound sets for new animations. While the number of supported animations may not be 'infinite' as the name suggests, it should be large enough to accommodate everyone's present (and in all likelihood future) needs.
		</p><br>

		<h2>Compatibility</h2><br>

		<h3>Games supported</h3>

		<p style="margin-top:2%;">
			Infinity Animations is designed to work on most Infinity Engine games. This includes:
		</p>
		<ul style="margin-left: 5%;">
			<li>The series of Enhanced Editions published by Beamdog, which at present includes Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition (BGEE), Baldur's Gate II: Enhanced Edition (BG2EE) and Icewind Dale: Enhanced Edition (IWDEE). The BGEE Siege of Dragonspear expansion (SoD) is supported as well. All of the Enhanced Edition games include the original expansion packs, e.g. IWDEE includes Heart of Winter (HoW) and Trials of the Luremaster (TotLM).</li>
			<li>The original Baldur's Gate II (BG2, or just SoA) with the Throne of Bhaal (ToB) expansion. <strong>Make sure you have Throne of Bhaal patched to version 26498.</strong> Check the ReadMe files related to your patch in your game folder and the <a href="http://www.bioware.com/games/throne_bhaal/support/patches/">BioWare</a> website if necessary.</li>
			<li>The conversion projects based on <acronym title="Throne of Bhaal">ToB</acronym>: <a href="http://www.shsforums.net/forum/261-bgt-weidu/"><strong>Baldur's Gate Trilogy (BGT)</strong></a>, <a href="https://www.pocketplane.net/bg1tutu/"><strong>Baldur's Gate <acronym title="Baldur's Gate 'To Two'">Tutu</acronym></strong></a> (and EasyTutu) and <a href="https://github.com/K4thos/EET/releases"><strong>Enhanced Edition Trilogy</strong></a> (EET).</li>
		</ul><br>


		<hr style="width: 90%;"/><br>


		<h3>Other Mods Compatibility</h3>

		<p style="margin-top:2%;">
			This mod is a <acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym> mod, and therefore should be compatible with all WeiDU mods. Though we are striving to make Infinity Animations compatible with as many other mods as possible, there is always a chance that incompatibilities will arise. Below are the ones discovered thus far:
		</p>
		<ul style="margin-left: 5%;">
			<li><a href="https://forums.beamdog.com/discussion/19501/resource-pack-extended-animations/p1">Viader's Extended Animations</a></li>
			<li>...</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			If you encounter any bugs, please <a href="http://www.shsforums.net/forum/594-infinity-animations/">report them on the forum!</a>
		</p><br>


		<hr style="width: 90%;"/><br>


		<h3>Installation Order</h3>

		<p style="margin-top:2%;">
			&#10173; Although it is not required for Infinity Animations to function properly, ToB players are strongly recommended to download and install the <a href="https://www.gibberlings3.net/mods/fixes/bg2fixpack/">BG2 Fixpack</a> before proceeding with the installation of this mod.
		</p><br>
		<p>
			In a perfect world, Infinity Animations would be installed as a data base that would be usable by anyone who would like to add animation entries to the game without being bogged down by issues of mod conflicts and incompatibilities. Unfortunately, since it was designed a long time after the first megamods generation that were overwriting game files, in particular to resolve animation conflicts and restore standard animations that megamods have overwritten; it needs to be installed after those megamods, at least until their authors will update them to benefit from Infinity Animations content... &#128577;
		</p>
		<p>
			While waiting for this marvelous day, here is the recommended installation order:
		</p>
		<ul style="margin-left: 5%;">
			<li>Please install Infinity Animations after ToBEx, BG2 Fixpack, EET, and mods that add creatures or animations.</li>
			<li>Please install Infinity Animations before 1PP, EET_end, and any final "biffing" routines.</li>
		</ul><br>

		<p>
			<strong><span style="color: #781808;">&#9755;</span></strong> &#9888;&#65039; Modders who wish to make their mods compatible with Infinity Animations are strongly recommended to read the <a href="ia-note-for-modders.html">IA Note for modders</a> which guides them through each step of accomplishing particular modding tasks without breaking compatibility.
		</p><br>


		<hr style="width: 90%;" /><br>


		<p>
			<strong>Start a new game</strong> after installing this mod, or use the "<a href="#9900">Saved Games Animations Fixer</a>" component if you're reluctant to do that.

		<h2>Installation</h2><br>

		<h3>Notes</h3>

		<p style="margin-top:2%;">
			<em>If you've previously installed the mod, remove it before extracting the new version. To do this, run <strong><span class="weidu">&nbsp;setup-infinityanimations.exe&nbsp;</span></strong>, un-install all previously installed components and delete the &#x1F4C1; infinityanimations folder.</em>
		</p>
		<p>
			<em>When installing or un-installing, <strong>do not close the <acronym title="Disk Operating System">DOS</acronym> window</strong> by clicking on the <strong>X</strong> button! Instead, press the <strong>Enter</strong> key whenever instructed to do so.</em>
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>Disable any antivirus</strong> or other memory-resident software before installing this or any other mod. Some (particularly avast and Norton!) have a tendency to report false positives with mod activity, resulting in failed installs.
		</p>
		<p>
			You can extract files from the archive using <a href="https://www.7-zip.org/download.html">7zip</a>, <a href="https://www.rarlab.com/download.htm">WinRAR</a>, <a href="https://zipgenius.com/">ZipGenius</a> or another file compression utility that handles .zip files.

				<p style="width:96%; color:#5f5f5f;">
					<strong>Important:</strong> Download all content you may require from the Infinity Animations download category at <a href="http://www.shsforums.net/files/category/98-infinity-animations/">Spellhold Studios</a>. If in doubt, download them all (most megamod installs will need all archives). Extract all archives using the "<em>Do not extract paths</em>" option on the <strong>Advanced</strong> tab in WinRAR. Also, make sure the "Destination path" on the <strong>General</strong> tab terminates in <strong>/content</strong> or <strong>/restore</strong> after <strong>infinityanimations</strong> (there should be no sub folders beyond that).
				</p>
				<p style="width:96%; color:#5f5f5f;">
					Extract all archives to the &#x1F4C1; /content folder except IA_BG2_Restores.rar, which should go in the &#x1F4C1; /restore folder. If you extract IA_Wh_Dr_Wyv_LoP.rar (currently only needed for the Planar Sphere mod), you can delete the sub-archive The_Lady's_Shadow.rar after extraction, as it is currently unused due to animation size limitations.
				</p>
				<p style="width:96%; color:#5f5f5f;">
					For WinZip, make sure the "Use folder names" box is <em>unselected</em>.
				</p>
				<p style="width:96%; color:#5f5f5f;">
					You should end up with a bunch of .bam files and no sub-folders in your &#x1F4C1; "content" and/or "restore" folders. The installer will warn you if you're missing anything you need, at which point you can exit it, download missing content, extract it and rerun the installer.

		<h3>Special Note for Siege of Dragonspear from Steam/GOG</h3>

		<p style="margin-top:2%;">
			Good Old Games (GOG) and Steam both package the additional content for Siege of Dragonspear in a method that <acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym>, the tool used to install this mod, cannot access. You must run a program called <a href="https://github.com/Argent77/A7-DlcMerger/releases/latest">DLC Merger</a> on your SoD installation before you can install this or any other WeiDU-based mod.
		</p><br>


		<hr style="width: 90%;"/><br>


		<h3>Enhanced Editions Note</h3>

		<p style="margin-top:2%;">
			The Enhanced Editions are actively supported games. Please note that every patch update will wipe your current mod setup! If in the middle of a modded game you might want to delay the patch update (if possible) as even after reinstalling the mods, you might not be able to continue with your old savegames. Alternatively, copy the whole game's folder into a new one that can be modded and will stay untouched by game patches. It is important that you install the mod to the language version you are playing the game in. Otherwise, the dialogues of the mod will not show but give error messages.
		</p><br>


		<hr style="width: 90%;"/><br>


		<h3>Windows</h3>

		<p style="margin-top:2%;">
			Infinity Animations for Windows is distributed as an extractable compressed archive and includes a <acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym> installer.
		</p>
		<p>
			Extract the contents of the mod to the folder of the game you wish to modify (<em>the folder which contains the "CHITIN.KEY" file</em>). On successful extraction, there should be a &#x1F4C1; infinityanimations folder and a setup-infinityanimations.exe file in your game folder. To install, simply double-click <strong><span class="weidu">&nbsp;setup-infinityanimations.exe&nbsp;</span></strong> and follow the instructions on screen.
		</p>
		<p>
			Run <strong><span class="weidu">&nbsp;setup-infinityanimations.exe&nbsp;</span></strong> in your game folder to reinstall, un-install or otherwise change components.
		</p><br>


		<hr style="width: 90%;"/><br>


		<h3>Mac OS X</h3>

		<div class="important" style="width: 85%; margin-top:2%;">
			<p style ="width: 100%;">&#9888;&#65039; Unfortunately, <strong>this mod is not currently fully compatible with OS X</strong> because the main component patching exe file does not support OS X. If you wish to make it so, please post your interest in the <a href="http://www.shsforums.net/forum/594-infinity-animations/">forum</a>. (It may help to examine your game launcher and the contents of the existing patch in an editor if you have any technical expertise.)</p><br>
			<p style ="width: 100%;">&#128541; <strong>However, </strong>since EE games don't need to be patched to benefit from Infinity Animations, <strong>it can be installed on Mac OS X EE games</strong>.</p>
		</div>

		<p>
			Infinity Animations for EE for Mac OS X is distributed in the same compressed archive and includes a <acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym> installer.
		</p>
		<p>
			First, extract the files from the archive into your game directory. On successful extraction, there should be a &#x1F4C1; infinityanimations folder, setup-infinityanimations and setup-infinityanimations.command files in your game folder. To install, double-click <strong><span class="weidu">&nbsp;setup-infinityanimations.command&nbsp;</span></strong> and follow the instructions on screen.
		</p>
		<p>
			You can run <strong><span class="weidu">&nbsp;setup-infinityanimations.command&nbsp;</span></strong> in your game folder to reinstall, un-install or otherwise the components settings.
		</p><br>


		<hr style="width: 90%;"/><br>


		<h3>Linux</h3>

		<p style="margin-top:2%;">
			Infinity Animations for Linux is distributed in the same compressed archive and does not include a <acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym> installer.
		</p>
		<p>
			Extract the contents of the mod to the folder of the game you wish to modify.
		</p>
		<p>
			Download the latest Linux version of <a href="https://github.com/WeiDUorg/weidu/releases"><acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym></a> and copy weidu and weinstall to <span class="weidu">/usr/bin</span>. Then open a terminal and <strong><span class="weidu">&nbsp;cd&nbsp;</span></strong> to your game installation directory.
		</p>
		<p>
			<em>Optional: run 'tolower' and answer 'Y' to both queries. You can avoid running the second option (linux.ini) if you've already ran it once in the same directory. To save time, the archive is already tolowered, so there's no need to run the first option (lowercasing file names) either, if you've extracted only this mod since the last time you lowercased file names. If unsure, running tolower and choosing both options is the safe bet.</em>
		</p>
		<p>
			Run <strong><span class="weidu">&nbsp;weinstall setup-infinityanimations&nbsp;</span></strong> in your game folder to install the mod. Then run <strong><span class="weidu">&nbsp;wine bgmain.exe&nbsp;</span></strong> (or <strong><span class="weidu">&nbsp;wine baldur.exe&nbsp;</span></strong> for EE games), and start playing.
		</p><br>


		<hr style="width: 90%;"/><br>


		<h3>Note for Complete Un-installation</h3>

		<p style="margin-top:2%;">
			In addition to the methods above for removing individual components, you can completely un-install the mod using <strong><span class="weidu">&nbsp;setup-infinityanimations --uninstall&nbsp;</span></strong> at the command line to remove all components without wading through prompts.
		</p><br>


		<hr style="width: 90%;"/><br>


		<a name="config" id="config"></a>
		<h3>&#9888;&#65039; Warning: new installation process</h3>

		<p style="margin-top:2%;">
			<strong><span style="font-variant:small-caps;font-size: 12px;margin-left: 30px;">As of version 6.0.0, configuration options needed for installation are read from <a href="../infinityanimations-config-default.ini"><em>infinityanimations-config-default.ini</em></a> file, or <em>infinityanimations-config-user.ini</em> if it exists.</span></strong>
		</p><br>
		<p>
			The previous versions needed all required content to be downloaded from the Infinity Animations download category at <a href="http://www.shsforums.net/files/category/98-infinity-animations/">Spellhold Studios</a> and extracted into the infinityanimations &#x1F4C1; <strong>content</strong> or &#x1F4C1; <strong>restore</strong> sub-folders. The installer warned you if you were missing anything you need, at which point you could exit it, download missing content, extract it and rerun the installer.
		</p>
		<p>
			From now on, the content needed by Infinity Animations is included in the &#x1F4C1; <strong>archives</strong> folder and automatically copied by the main component into your &#x1F4C1; <strong>override</strong> folder. Being useless, the respective &#x1F4C1; <em>content</em> and &#x1F4C1; <em>restore</em> sub-folders have been removed.
		</p>
		<p>
			Now, the whole archives folder content will be installed by default. If you want to define your own customized installation, you have to edit <strong><em><span style="font-variant:small-caps;font-size: 12px;">infinityanimations-config-default.ini</em></span></strong> (in &#x1F4C1; infinityanimations folder) with Notepad or another text editor, then save it as <strong><span style="font-variant:small-caps;font-size: 12px;"><em>infinityanimations-config-user.ini</em></span></strong>.
		</p>
		<p>
			Each line consists of an installation option, then '=', then a number. The only thing you should edit is the number. For example, if you don't want to install the svirneblins animations, change the ia_iwd_svirfneblin value to 0.
		</p>
		<p>
			The installation process will read both .ini files and prioritize user's option values. If a value is not set or mismatched in infinityanimations-config-user.ini, any installation failure will be prevented by reverting it back to its <em>default</em> value.
		</p>
		<p>
			If you want to install a component requiring files that you have decided not to install, the installer will install them automatically if there are still in the &#x1F4C1; archives folder. Otherwise, it will warn you. In this case, you will have to exit the installer, extract them in your mod folder, and rerun the installer.<br>
			Following the above example, if you indeed wish the svirneblins get the svirneblins animations after having set ia_iwd_svirfneblin option to 0, the installer will force their installation if it finds them in &#x1F4C1; archives folder. If not, it will warn you to extract them before installing the component.
		</p>

		<p>
			Here is a chart listing the options related to the installation process:

		<h2>Troubleshooting</h2><br>

		<p>
			These are some general tips if you have problems getting the game working, with or without this or other mods. Many times, errors have to do with the game engine itself or the manner of installation or gameplay. The game recommends deleting all files out of the /cache, /temp and /tempsave &#x1F4C1; sub-folders in your game folder to see if that resolves the problem before any further troubleshooting.
		</p><br>

		<hr style="width: 90%;"/><br>

		<p>
			<strong>Symptom: Game freezes or crashes to desktop (CTDs)</strong>
		</p><br>

		<p>
			Sometimes the game displays an "assertion error" in a pop-up window when this happens, but often times it doesn't. To enable the full error message, open the file <strong>baldur.ini</strong> in your me folder with a text editor (such as Notepad). If you find you can't edit it or save changes in Windows Vista or 7, see <a href="http://forums.bioware.com/viewtopic.html?topic=662080&forum=10"> this topic</a> for assistance.
		</p>
		<p>
			Under the [Program Options] section in the file, type <strong> Logging On=1</strong> (unless it's already there). While you're there, you may also want to make sure <strong>Debug Mode=1</strong> is there to enable the <a href="https://gibberlings3.github.io/iesdp/appendices/clua/bg2.htm">CLUA Console</a> for debugging and testing. Save the file and exit. Now go back into the game and try to reproduce the crash. Then look in your game folder again for the <strong>Baldur.err</strong> file and open it with a text editor to analyse its contents.
		</p><br>

		<hr style="width: 90%;"/><br>

		<p>
			<strong>Symptom: Game crashes with no Baldur.err log and shows either a black screen or a pop-up window indicating an error at offset 005ca8a8s</strong>
		</p><br>

		<p>
			This usually indicates an animation-related issue. Make sure you have the latest version of the mod. If you've installed other mods after it and have this issue, install the fix available <a href="http://www.shsforums.net/files/file/884-ia-aurora-low-fix/">here</a>.
		</p><br>

		<hr style="width: 90%;"/><br>

		<p>
			<strong>Symptom:</strong>
		</p>

		<div class="important" style="background-color: black;color: #deded9;">
			<p style="font-family: Courier New;font-size: 100%;">
				<strong>ERROR: error copying [infinityanimations/content/somefile.bam]<br>

				Stopping installation because of error.</strong> (with no other error message)<br>
			</p>
		</div>

		<p>
			Less-than-informative messages like these may indicate you're installing to a hard drive with a low data transfer rate or an antivirus program is active during installation (which can also affect data transfer). Try installing to an internal drive with antivirus protection disabled during the install. If unsure, disconnect from the Internet (either unplug your network cable or disable your wireless adaptor) and turn off <strong>all</strong> memory-resident programs during the install. To get a list of these, go to Start > Run and type <strong><span class="weidu">&nbsp;msconfig&nbsp;</span></strong> where it says "<em>Open:</em>" then click OK. When the System Configuration Utility appears, click on the Startup tab. The only really necessary programs that need to be loaded in memory at startup are those related to your graphics chip (typically ATI or NVIDIA). Uncheck everything else, reboot and try installing the mod again. There are well-documented issues with installing mods while Avast antivirus is running, so make absolutely sure all components of Avast are completely disabled.

		<p>
			If none of this resolves your issue, or you have mod-specific issues, please report the problem in the mod's <a href="http://www.shsforums.net/forum/594-infinity-animations">forum</a>.

			<li>Infinity Animations now automatically installs creatures sound clips accordingly to the game language localization whenever relevant. However, a <a href="#forcelanguage">variable</a> set in <em>infinityanimations-config-default.ini</em> file gives the choice to bypass the default soundset language.</li>
		  </ul><br>

		<h5>&nbsp;<span style="color: #781808;">&#9755;</span>&nbsp;&nbsp; General overhaul and re-looking:</h5>

		  <ul style="width: 90%">
			<li>Added <em>infinityanimations.ini</em> metadata file to support AL|EN's "Project Infinity".</li>
			<li>Renamed <em>setup-infinityanimations.tp2</em> -> <em>infinityanimations.tp2</em> to support AL|EN's "Project Infinity".</li>
			<li>Replaced <span class="tp2">AUTHOR</span> keyword with <span class="tp2">SUPPORT</span>.</li>
			<li>Added missing <span class="tp2">REQUIRE_PREDICATE</span> conditions to avoid installing components in inaccurate games or if required components are not installed.</li>

			<li>...</li>
			<li>Added components <span class="tp2">LABELS</span>.</li>
			<li>Added "<em>always.tpa</em>" library.</li>
			<li>Installation options have been moved into <em>infinityanimations-config-default.ini</em> file. If you want to modify them, please read this <a href="#config">chapter</a>.</li>
			
			<li>...</li>
			<li>Split code into separate components libraries for more comfortable readability and maintenance. &#128521;</li>
			<li>Moved components tpa files into new &#x1F4C1; "<em>components</em>" folder and kept functions and macros in &#x1F4C1; "<em>lib</em>" folder.</li>
			<li>Commented code as much as possible.</li>
			<li>Changed lines of code to provide EE compatibility whenever possible, in particular the animations names have been harmonized.</li>
			<li>Re-formated .log files entries to be more friendly readable.</li>
			
			<li>...</li>

			<li>Coding simplification:</li>
			  <ul>
				<li style="margin-left:-4%; margin-right:-1%;">Used new and more efficient <acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym> functions (not released when Erephine wrote this mod) and got rid of deprecated functions (such as <span class="tp2">DECOMPILE_BCS_TO_BAF</span> and <span class="tp2">DECOMPILE_DLG_TO_D</span> replaced with <span class="tp2">DECOMPILE_AND_PATCH</span>).</li>
				<li style="margin-left:-4%">Used new <a href="http://www.shsforums.net/user/10485-sam/">Sam</a>'s <span class="tp2">ps_recursive_copy.tpa</span> library, a <acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym> action function that will recursively search files into a parent directory, then copy them to a destination directory; and Gwendolyne's <span class="tp2">gw_install_archives</span> and <span class="tp2">gw_update_content</span> macros to install all needed animations and sounds files from archives/subfolders to override folder.</li>
				<li style="margin-left:-4%">Replaced specific "<em>%tsx%</em>" IA variables with more compatible "<em>%tutu%_scriptx%</em>" variables: from now on, IA uses up-to-date <em>crossmod platform variables</em>.</li>
				<li style="margin-left:-4%">Updated <span class="tp2">fj_cre_validity.tpp</span>, <span class="tp2">fj_cre_reindex.tpp</span> and <span class="tp2">fj_cre_eff_v2.tpp</span> patch functions to <acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym> new versions standards.</li>
				<li style="margin-left:-4%">Enjoy Gwendolyne's silent <span class="tp2">gw_handle_audio</span>, adapted from <acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym> <span class="tp2">HANDLE_AUDIO</span> action function, that may make installation a more easy-on-the-eyes visual experience!</li>
				<li style="margin-left:-4%">Externalized lists of creatures to be patched into arrays for easier maintenance.</li>
				<li style="margin-left:-4%">Minor fixes...</li>
			  </ul>

			<li>...</li>
 
			<li>Re-formated, updated (new animation pictures...) and renamed readme files to "<em>infinityanimations-readme-%LANGUAGE%.html</em>" (Infinity Animations now supports translated readmes).</li>
			<li>Added French translation (Gwendolyne).</li>
			<li>New traification. Feel free to provide me with translations. I will include them as soon as possible.</li>
			<li>...</li>
			<li>Reorganized folders architecture tree: created sub-folders to sort animations and sound clips files according to creature types and/or language localization.</li>
			<li>Lower cased files.</li>
			<li>Added OggDec v1.9.7 and sox v14.4.1 for Mac.</li>
			<li>Added archive libiconv-1.9.2-1-src.7z with iconv licence info.</li>
			<li>Updated <acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym> installer to v247.</li>
			<li>Uploaded mod to official Spellhold Studios GitHub mirror account.</li>
