Note to translators:

Translations should be encoded in UTF-16 LE BOM.  UTF-8 will NOT work.

Translations should be placed in <.\Path To Reference Picker\lang\> and should be named [Language].txt where [Language] is your language, e.g. English.  This file should be formatted as an INI file, and the translated strings should be placed under a Section named [Language] (again where this is YOUR language, e.g. English).  Use English.txt as an example.

You tell IA Reference Picker to use a particular language by editing Config.txt.  Under the Section "Program" you will find a key "UseLang"; set the value of this key to [Language] e.g. UseLang=English would load the strings from <.\lang\English.txt>.  The strings are loaded at runtime, so if you change the language after starting IA Reference Picker, you will need to restart it for the changes to take effect.

The text contains some special characters that should be left as-is:
	*  ` (backtick) is an escape character, and causes the following character either to be interpreted literally by AHK or to give it special meaning.  For example, `n is resolved into a linefeed and `r is resolved into a carriage return.  Do not modify or translate these.
	*  % (percent) signs are used to enclose variables that will be dereferenced just before being displayed e.g. %ID%G1.  These should not be modified or translated.
