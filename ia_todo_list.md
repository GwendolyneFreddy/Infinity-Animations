#### Before official release

- [ ] Remove all DEBUGGING CONTROL LOG messages

## 

#### Humanoid Animations Fixes component

- [ ] Male Sailors get the sailor_man animation: add new options with new IA_EE content (colored sailors)?
- [ ] Male human Shadow Thieves get the shadow_thief animation: add arnfgt04, flyfgt02, flyfgt03 and repthf12?

## 

#### Distinctive Genies component

- [ ] Djinnis: ddguard2 and ddguard3 class is GENIE_EFREETI. Should they be reverted into the efreeti array?

## 

#### Distinctive Fiends component

- [ ] Erinyes get wings and elf animations: write a better 1pp compatibility?

## 

#### More IWD Animations component

## 

#### BG1 Animations for NPCs component

- [ ] Why not dynamically build all arrays?

## 

#### EE version

- [ ] All components: list all EE games specific creatures that need to be patched
- [ ] Distinctive Fiends component: Is it very useful to add creatures sound clips for EE games?
