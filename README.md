# Infinity-Animations
This mod patches Baldur's Gate II: Throne of Bhaal to support additional creature and character animations (referred to as 'animation slots'). It also offers a dynamic automated process for claiming new animation slots. Thus, it acts as a central hub, usable by anyone who would like to add animation entries to the game without being bogged down by issues of mod conflicts and incompatibilities.
